# Calculator
Here's a breakdown of the C++ code you provided:

1. Header Files:
iostream: Provides input and output functionalities like cin and cout.
conio.h: Contains non-standard functions like getch() for console input.
math.h: Offers mathematical functions like sqrt() for square root.
stdlib.h: Includes general utilities like system() for system calls.
iomanip: Allows for formatted output using manipulators like setw().

2. Functions:
sum(): Calculates the sum of multiple numbers entered by the user.
diff(): Finds the difference between two numbers.
pro(): Computes the product of multiple numbers.
div(): Calculates the quotient of two numbers (integer division).
power(): Raises a number to a specified power.
sq(): Calculates the square root of a number.
fact(): Finds the factorial of a number.
expo(): Calculates the value of e raised to a specified power.

3. Main Function:
main(): The entry point of the program.
It implements a menu-driven interface using a do-while loop.
The user selects an operation from the menu (or exits).
Based on the choice, the corresponding function is called.
The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.

4. Key Points:
The code uses a global variable op to store the user's choice.
It employs the system("cls") function (non-standard) to clear the screen.
The switch statement directs the program flow based on the user's choice.
The getch() function (non-standard) waits for a final key press before exiting.

5. Potential Issues and Improvements:
Non-standard functions like conio.h and system("cls") might not be portable across different platforms.
Integer division in div() might lead to unexpected results for decimal values.
Consider using more descriptive variable names and adding comments for better readability.
Explore error handling for invalid user input.
Implement input validation to prevent potential crashes.
Enhance the calculator's functionality with additional operations (e.g., trigonometric functions, logarithms).
